Step 4: Answer the question:


##Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

##Answer:For label 0 (healthy loan), the precision is 1.00, indicating that all predicted healthy loans are actually healthy. For label 1 (high-risk loan), the precision is 0.85, meaning that 85% of the predicted high-risk loans are actually high-risk.


**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** Overall, the logistic regression model fitted with oversampled data demonstrates strong predictive performance for both healthy and high-risk loans, with high precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, geometric mean, and index of balanced accuracy.
For pre:
For label 0 (healthy loan), the precision is 1.00, indicating that all predicted healthy loans are actually healthy.
For label 1 (high-risk loan), the precision is 0.84, meaning that 84% of the predicted high-risk loans are actually high-risk.
